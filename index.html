          Hello there, my name is George Kelly. I am an aspiring <span class="term">Web developer</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have some skills in <span class="term">Python Programming language</span> which is as many say, simple but powerful language.There are many programming languages out there but I chose it because apart from it being mostly used in Web Development it is also used in <span class="term">Data Analytics and Machine Learning</span>. In addition to this, I also have an idea of what <span class="term">JavaScript</span> entails and I look forward to perfect my skills over there too.
