            Welcome to my about section, I am an aspiring web developer with a love for crafting creative and functional solutions. My journey into the world of <span class="term">web development</span> started when I was when I just finished highschool, my older brother who is one of the peope I look upto asked me to just not sit and wait to join school which is almost a year away and challenged me to get busy. I had a interest on how webapps like Youtube are created but I really did not see myself at the core working on it at the time. Duncan- my elder brother sat me down and gave me a deeper understanding of how they work and mentioned the technologies e.g <span class="term">HTML, CSS</span> and <span class="term">javaScript</span> used and thats when I started my learning journey.
            <br>
            Apart from coding, I enjoy playing video games which I use an outlet after hours of staring at code and it really helps me to refresh my mind and get it back going every morning.
